### **1. Scene Components**
Youâ€™ll need:
- A 3D rendering engine (e.g., OpenGL)
- Space environment simulation (stars, planets, lighting)
- Camera sensor physics (exposure, noise, spectral response)
- Spacecraft models loaded as 3D assets

#### **Recommended Libraries**  
- **ModernGL**: For OpenGL-based rendering in Python  
- **PyOpenGL**: Low-level OpenGL bindings for custom effects  
- **Trimesh**: For loading spacecraft models (.obj/.stl)  
- **Noise**: For simulating sensor noise  
- **numpy/PyTorch**: For numerical computations  

### Notes:
- **Lighting:** Simplified model using basic distance falloff. Use PBR shaders for realism.
- **Materials:** Add more material types (e.g., glass, plastic).
- **Noise:** Implement temporal noise and readout noise patterns.
- **Optimization:** Use texture atlasing or instancing for large starfields.

This framework provides a foundation for simulating realistic space scenes. For production use, consider adding:
1. Ray tracing for accurate reflections/shadows
2. Dynamic lighting (e.g., sun flares)
3. Particle effects (thrusters, debris)
4. Lens flare and bloom effects
5. Motion blur for spacecraft movement
